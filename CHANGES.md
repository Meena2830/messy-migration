## Project: messy-migration — User Management API Refactor

### 🔧 Summary

The original codebase was functional but had major structural, security, and maintainability issues. This refactor aimed to cleanly restructure the project using FastAPI best practices, proper data validation, and secure handling of user credentials.

---

### ❌ Issues Found in the Original Code

1. **Lack of structure** – All logic (routes, models, database logic) was in one file.
2. **No input validation** – Missing schema checks for user input.
3. **Password security** – Passwords were stored in plain text.
4. **Inconsistent error handling** – No proper HTTP status codes or error messages.
5. **No separation of concerns** – DB logic and route logic were tightly coupled.
6. **No use of async or modern FastAPI features**.
7. **No login/auth logic implemented**.
8. **No environment or dependency setup instructions**.
9. **No documentation for the API**.

---

### ✅ Changes Implemented

1. ✅ **Modular structure**
   - Split into `routers/`, `schemas/`, `models/`, and `main.py`.

2. ✅ **Added Pydantic schemas**
   - `UserBase`, `UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`, `UserLogin` ensure strict validation.

3. ✅ **Password hashing**
   - Integrated `bcrypt` to securely store hashed passwords.

4. ✅ **API endpoints restructured**
   - Clean `POST /users/`, `GET /users/`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `POST /login`.

5. ✅ **Login logic added**
   - Login endpoint validates hashed password correctly.

6. ✅ **Database setup**
   - SQLAlchemy used with SQLite.
   - `init_db.py` initializes database.

7. ✅ **Consistent responses**
   - Return `JSONResponse` with clear messages and proper HTTP status codes.

8. ✅ **Dependency setup**
   - `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages.
   - Clear `README.md` instructions for setup (optional).

### 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

Used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to assist in:
- Structuring folder layout
- Writing and validating Pydantic models
- Fixing password hashing logic
- Reviewing best practices for FastAPI

All AI-generated content was reviewed and tested manually before submission.

### ✅ Final Notes

- All routes tested via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Live reload working with:
  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Database initialized with:
    python init_db.py



Run tests:
pip install pytest httpx
pytest test_user.py
